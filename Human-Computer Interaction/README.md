**About Assignment**

The task of this assignment is to develop an user interface for a household appliance. My team chose to develop a smartphone application for ACs (Air Conditions) using Android JAVA. 

Main focus of this assignment is to get familiar with the steps,techniques and the methods of evaluation that are used widely when developing an app.

Unfortunately, the code is not 100% available. (Our professor asked us to upload only the report).
